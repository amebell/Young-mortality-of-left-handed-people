# Left-handed people mortality

#### Topic
A [1991 study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104043241418) reported that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. Nine years! Could this really be true? 
In this notebook, we will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. 

#### Coding
This notebook uses <code>pandas</code> and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.

#### Literature
A National Geographic survey in 1986 resulted in over a million responses that included age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing. Researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki analyzed this data and noticed that rates of left-handedness were around 13% for people younger than 40 but decreased with age to about 5% by the age of 80. They concluded based on analysis of a subgroup of people who throw left-handed but write right-handed that this age-dependence was primarily due to changing social acceptability of left-handedness. This means that the rates aren't a factor of <em>age</em> specifically but rather of the <em>year you were born</em>, and if the same study was done today, we should expect a shifted version of the same distribution as a function of age. Ultimately, we'll see what effect this changing rate has on the apparent mean age of death of left-handed people, but let's start by plotting the rates of left-handedness as a function of age.

#### Datasets
This notebook uses two datasets: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/vs00199_table310.pdf">death distribution data</a> for the United States from the year 1999 (source website <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_tables.htm">here</a>) and rates of left-handedness digitized from a figure in this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1528408">1992 paper by Gilbert and Wysocki</a>. </p>
